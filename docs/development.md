# Local development

## Rust toolchain

This repository pins `nightly-2026-10-25` with `rustc-codegen-cranelift`, `rustfmt`, and `clippy`, matching the local `daftprompt` toolchain reference. Install it with:

```sh
rustup toolchain install nightly-2026-10-25 \
  --profile minimal \
  --component rustc-codegen-cranelift \
  --component rustfmt \
  --component clippy
```

Cargo's [`.cargo/config.toml`](../.cargo/config.toml) selects Cranelift for development and test profiles. The component alone does not select the backend. Check the installed components and selected backend from the repository root:

```sh
rustup show active-toolchain
rustup component list --installed
cargo build -v
```

The verbose build command should include `-Z codegen-backend=cranelift` in the `rustc` invocation. If Cargo reports an unsupported `codegen-backend` profile key, check that the pinned nightly is active and the component is installed.

Run local checks with:

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo check
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

If a locally configured `sccache` Rust wrapper fails with a permission error, prefix these commands with `RUSTC_WRAPPER=` to run `rustc` directly.

## Local database

The storage library opens `local-data/wrkgn.sqlite` by default. Set `WRKGN_DB_PATH` to a different SQLite file when needed. Its parent directory is created automatically. The working database belongs outside any public website directory; the default `local-data/` path and `.env` files are ignored by Git.

SQL migrations in `migrations/` are applied transactionally using SQLite's `user_version`. The source tables retain raw HN payloads, item IDs, authors, original timestamps, parent IDs, sibling order, deleted/dead flags, and first/last fetch times. Each changed source snapshot gets a numbered revision; a repeat fetch with identical source data only advances its last fetch time. Content fingerprints cover the body, title, URL, author, original timestamp, and deleted/dead state, while child-list and score changes are excluded. The revision history still records raw payload changes.

Collection runs record their start, finish, fetched item count, and failure count. Failed and unavailable fetches are separate records and cannot mark an existing item deleted. A run with recorded failures finishes as `incomplete`. If a prior run was interrupted, the next run marks it incomplete with an interruption flag and starts a new full-tree refresh. This replay preserves previously fetched items and creates revisions only for changed source data.

Only a complete refresh can mark a previously stored item as absent from the current HN reply tree. This `present_in_tree` state is separate from the item's explicit `deleted` and `dead` flags and gets its own revision. An incomplete run leaves prior tree presence unchanged. When an item reappears, its presence and revision are restored. `Store::conversation_groups` returns date-preserving source records as ordered top-level comment subtrees; downstream processing must check the latest run is complete before using them.

## HN collection library

`Collector` accepts a supplied thread item ID and an `HnApi` transport. The production transport reads the public HN item endpoint with a 15-second request timeout; tests inject offline fixture responses. The collector fetches the root and each listed descendant, preserving the `kids` order as sibling positions and validating child parent IDs. At most eight item fetches run concurrently by default. Transient network errors, HTTP 429, and HTTP 5xx responses receive up to three attempts with bounded delay.

A JSON `null`, malformed item, failed request, duplicate child reference, or parent mismatch makes the run incomplete and identifies the affected item in `fetch_failures`. An explicit `deleted` or `dead` field is stored as source state. A failed or null fetch never changes that state. No live collection runs during builds or tests; a deliberate live smoke test awaits a supplied monthly discussion ID.

## CLI usage

After choosing an actual HN discussion item ID, run either command deliberately:

```sh
cargo run -- collect --thread <hn-item-id>
cargo run -- process --thread <hn-item-id>
```

Pass `--db <path>` to either command to override `WRKGN_DB_PATH` and the default database path. `collect` only fetches and stores the thread and replies. A complete collection exits with status 0; an incomplete collection exits with status 1 and lists affected item IDs and failure reasons.

`process` currently performs the same collection, then reports that extraction and public export are not implemented. It exits with status 2 even when collection succeeds; it does not produce publication data or report pipeline success. `wrkgn --help` shows command usage. Builds and tests do not fetch Hacker News data or call a model.

Run one collection command at a time for a given thread. A retry after an incomplete or interrupted run refetches the entire current tree, rather than only its failed item IDs, so changes elsewhere are also observed. A live smoke test still needs a supplied monthly discussion ID and deliberate execution.
